### Description of Fermat's Near Miss Calculator Program: 
This program helps users calculate near misses for 
Fermat's Last Theorem for given values of x, y, n, and k. It searches for combinations where x^n + y^n is close to z^n, and reports the smallest relative miss.
The user is prompted for a value of n that fits: 2 < n <12, and a value of k that fits: 10 <= x <= k, and where 10 <= y <= k. The program systematically searches for the closest near miss, reporting each new best found.


### How to run this program: 
Clone this repository to your computer and then open the folder into a coding editor such as VScode. 
Then run the main.py file and fill in the values for n and k in the terminal according to the constraints
given on the screen. Then sit back, relax, and watch the near misses of Fermat's Last Theorem roll in. 

### Any questions? 
Please refer to the comments throughout the code if you would like to learn more about how this works
and our emails are also provided in the main.py file as well.
